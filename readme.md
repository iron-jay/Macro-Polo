# Macro Polo #

-------------------

This add-in is design to detect if a file has a macro as its opened.<br>
If it does, it will show a message say if the macro has been digitally signed or not.

Example:<br>
Excel - unsigned:<br>
![excel](Images/excel-unsigned.png)

Excel - signed:<br>
![excel](Images/excel-signed.png)

Word - unsigned:<br>
![excel](Images/word-unsigned.png)
